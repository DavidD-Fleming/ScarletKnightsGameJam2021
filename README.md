# Jammin' Jelly (ScarletKnightsGameJam2021)

Heya! This is the final version of Jammin' Jelly, a two player platformer game made collaboratively with a game designer and an animator. This game was made under a week 
for the 2021 Scarlet Knights Game Jam with the theme of JAM. The point of the game is to progress through multiple levels by passing terrain and avoiding enemies. Other then
basic horizontal movement and a jump, each player has a unique ability. To fit the theme of JAM we gave one player the ability "jam out" and shoot sound waves that would knock
both players and enemies back and the other player the ability to create jam blocks which help the players jump higher and can bounce sound waves. Using teamwork and their
abilities, both players will be able to use different methods to pass enemies that can move around or shoot sound waves of their own (albeit more dangerous sound waves).

Jammin' Jelly was an interesting experience and was the first time I worked colloratively with other people to make a video game in a week. I learned a lot of new techniques such as
scene management and animating in 2D. This was also my first time creating a 2D platformer and realized the whole process is much more difficult then I thought. The hardest part of the game, programming wise,
was making the character controller for both players as there was simple and solid way to create 2D controls without some form of weird interaction. The primary issue was trying to get a function that
would properly detect if the player was grounded. I went through several iterations before I settled on using a rigidbody and boxcollider and get movement that was generally free
of weird interactions.

Unfortunately, the final version of Jammin' Jelly is not complete. Ironically, the hardest part of the game was setting up the foundation, which I was able to finish but it came too
close to the deadline for us to actually be able to create multiple levels to really show off the gameplay. We also found our animator too close to the deadline so she was not able
to make our assets in time before the final day. I ended up just making her a page in the game so we could at least show off her art. Other then that, the primary issue was bad
communication between myself and the game designer. The game designer had little to no experience with both programming and Unity so the expecations of what could be done in a week
was way out of proportion. There was already a lot of work for a single programmer to do in such a short time frame and having the game designer not really know what he was doing really
hurdled progress and made implementing features significantly harder since there really was not any specifications on how they should work.

Overall, I learned a few new tricks but my primary takeaway from this project was to really have a solid foundation of a project before just instantly signing up for it. Programming
is an activity that requires a fine level of detail so lacking such detail created unnessecary difficulties. I would like to come back and truly explore creating a platformer with maybe
more time to create it but as is, Jammin' Jelly is a fun game that does have a lot of really cool puzzle solving possibilities and can definitely be expanded further.

That's all!
